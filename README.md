Cant deploy as when i use this, "npm install vite-plugin-top-level-await --save-dev" it deleted and changed my webgi folders, preview 3d model cant load

We used npm install webgi and we got a different version which does not work, so we used another project file to copy and paste the webgi folder to this project and when deploy it changed the webgi folder and our 3D model doesnt load.
